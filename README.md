Tic-Tac-Toe Frontend Project Description

A Tic-Tac-Toe frontend project aims to create an interactive and visually appealing user interface for the classic two-player game. It typically involves:

Core Features:

Game Board: A visually appealing 3x3 grid where players can make their moves.
Player Turns: Alternating turns for two players, usually represented by "X" and "O".
Move Input: A mechanism for players to select their desired move on the board (e.g., clicking on a square).
Win/Lose Detection: Logic to determine if a player has won or if the game is a tie.
Game Over Screen: A display that announces the winner or a tie and provides options to play again.
Frontend Technologies:

HTML: To structure the game board and other elements.
CSS: To style the game board, players' symbols, and overall visual appearance.
JavaScript: To handle user interactions, game logic, and dynamic updates to the game board.
